##Overview

Mob team 5 looked at a few options to coordinate the Mob team programming. Basuki proposed Appear.me, and then Daryl proposed Webex.     
After a trial recording run, we settled on Cisco WebEx as Daryl had an account with them.

##Software

Via Cisco WebEx we shared a webinar with video, and voice to join together. We maintained a timer to share controls. 
We decided to share the same PC for programming to prevent having to compile and share the same code across multiple devices.

##Submissions
- We had code coverage above 90% as demonstrated by the file here: code-coverage.png
- We completed all Junit tests per : test-results.png 

##Video
A video of a portion of our Mob Programming session held on Saturday 10/1 at 2 PM EST is here:
